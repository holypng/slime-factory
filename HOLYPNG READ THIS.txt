-Game is good, illegible though
-Gameplay is bad 
-Colorama unnecessary imo, might as well switch to HTMl/ use pygame 
-DONT USE AI YOU WONT LEARN AS MUCH. THE SYSTEMS THIS GAME IS BUILT ON ARE QUITE COMPLEX, DANIEL DOESNT MAKE GAMES LIKE THESE NOR DO I
-Its much more worth it to make games from scratch by yourself
-Use ai for repetetive jobs/ideas/boilerplates
